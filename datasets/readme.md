THE CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION PANEL DATA SET
The data set consists of annual data for the 48 continental U.S. states from 1985 √ê 1995.  
Quantity consumed is measured by annual per capita cigarette sales in packs per fiscal year, 
as derived from state tax collection data.  The price is the average retail cigarette price 
per pack during the fiscal year, including taxes.  Income is per capita income.  
The general sales tax is the average tax, in cents per pack, due to the broad-based state sales 
tax applied to all consumption goods.  The cigarette-specific tax is the tax applied to 
cigarettes only.  All prices, income, and taxes used in the regressions in this chapter 
are deflated by the Consumer Price Index and thus are in constant (real) dollars.
